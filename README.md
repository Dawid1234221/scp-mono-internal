I checked this only with Windows 10.
But it should work with w7 also.


## Options

ESP - press Left Alt to change esp mode (cards only, weapon only, ammo only, everything, nothing).
Press X to teleport to exit from pocket dimension.
Press M to teleport to Nine Tailed spawn.
Press MOUSE3 (or even hold it) to enable noclip.
~~Press MOUSE4 to aimbot~~ (IT IS NOT WORKING).
Press K to teleport at Intermission room (Press Q to use intermission)

**Options for small keyboard (numeric keyboard):**
0 = disable teleporting
1 = teleport at class D position (above head)
2 = teleport at scientist position (above head)
3 = teleport at SCP position (above head)
4 = teleport at 9tailed position (above head)
5 = teleport at MTF position (above head)

This teleport function will hardlock target till it alive.
If target is dead there will be a new search for the same type target.
AND YES, YOU CAN AIM AT GROUND AND DESTROY EACH HEAD.
But be carefull SCP can catch you this way..

Press F7 to make super fast reloading and super fast shooting.
Press F8 to make fast reloading and medium speed shooting.

Press keypad + / - to mute all players (it's not finished in this version of hack but I can update with mute-menu later).
